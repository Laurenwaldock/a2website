Rationale 

As our final assignment for this unit, I expected to have more understanding of Code and the working of HTML. Truthfully, I did have a greater understanding of how code works and how to formulate it into the desired outcome. Learning how to use a static site generator was an interesting learning curve. In the beginning, it took a while to fully appreciate what the static site generator did, and whilst for this assignment I only made a single-page website, I can appreciate the time-saving factors of the static site. I still struggle a little navigating around the static sights of pre-made files and thus their structure. Downloading and setting up the static site generator was another major issue that slowed down this assignment's starting phase. I still am not entirely sure how it all works, but I feel more confident in my ability to use the command prompt, GitHub, brackets and HTML. 

Once all the factors were downloaded and set up; editing the formatted site was almost fun. I found it satisfying that all the code was there you just had to personalise it and add extra things needed. This also meant that the making of my sight was rather fast, and I think the real application for static sights was felt. In comparison to the last assignment, I found this one more enjoyable, more achievable and much faster to get a response from the code. 

For my approach to this assignment, I chose to focus on one artist from the previous assignment's content. I chose S.A.Adair, whose art I have seen in person. I liked her artistic style and incorporated that into my header and footer. On the single-page website, I wanted to showcase their art, but also provide information about S.A.Adair. I did this by breaking the written parts into sections, education, awards, etc. Inbetween each written section is a series of 3 images of one of the art pieces done by S.A.Adair. I liked the set of 3 images as it allows the audience to see multiple parts of one art installation, but also brings the images down in overall size and makes it easier for the audience to see and appreciate the artworks. Whilst my final page is quite basic in design, I believe it has a nice simplicity that does not overcrowd the featured artistic works. In future I would like to learn some more skills in HTML, to enable a more professional finish to the webpage, that could add depth and detail to my works.
